## Description

The-Movie Hub is a web app that allows users to see the full list of the latest and most popular movies. Users can click on movies to view their specific information like casts, runtime, average rating, and revenue data. Furthermore, users can choose to 'favorite' certain movies so that they can easily oragnize and catalog movies they enjoyed watching. There is also a 'favorite-count' number on each movie page, and everyone can see how many others have favorited the movie.
